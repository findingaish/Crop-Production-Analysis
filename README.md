# Crop Production Analysis in India

## Overview
This project aims to analyze crop production in India using machine learning techniques. The analysis focuses on understanding trends, factors affecting production, and predicting future production levels. 

## Problem Statement
The Agriculture business domain is expected to highly evolve in the upcoming years. This project addresses the need for data-driven insights in the agri-food sector by leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze crop production in India.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from [mention your dataset source here]. It includes historical data on crop production in India, including various crops, states, and relevant factors such as climate, soil type, and agricultural practices.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring relationships between different features, visualizing trends, and identifying patterns in the data.
3. Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and transforming data for modeling.
4. Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict crop production based on historical data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.
6. Deployment: Deploying the trained model for further analysis or integration into a larger system.
